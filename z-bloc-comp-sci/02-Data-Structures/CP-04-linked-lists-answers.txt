1.  What are some pros and cons of using linked lists instead of arrays?

    Pros of linked lists are they take up small amounts of memory meaning huge
    lists can be employed.  The main con of linked lists is that specific items
    are not as easily findable as in an array.

2.  Come up with a real world example of a linked list.

    I work in medical coding and billing presently.  On the main billing form
    there is a box where all the diagnosis codes get listed like an array.
    Further on, there is a line for the procedure which has a pointer box which
    points (links) to a specific diagnosis code.
